this is the 2nd version of encrypter and decrypter i made using cpp. 1st being in java.

i've made it easier to enter key as it is a single string rather than separate numbers i used in java encrypter.

it is not a file encrypter per se but a password encrypter. 

you can use it to save your passwords along with(out) key without worrying about data leaks as without this decrypter it is quite difficult to break this encryption.

(ps: if you are using vs code to run this remember that to press right mouse click to paste copied content(you will need it) )

im still inexperienced in writing readmes
